Description: In the past we have always generated summary statistics for each flowset for each timepoint and then annotated and analyzed
  these summary statistics. This method loses a great deal of the power that comes from the large amounts of individual cell data
  generated in flow cytometry, by essentially collapsing this data into a bulk measurement. The following functions will facilitate
  annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-lapse data utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of
  individual cells in each sample. This package was developed based for analysis of yeast expressing fluorescent proteins on a BD
  Accuri SORP cytometer, but may be adapted for analysis of other data.
