Description: In the past we have always generated summary statistics for
    each flowset for each timepoint and then annotated and analyzed these
    summary statistics. This method loses a great deal of the power that comes
    from the large amounts of individual cell data generated in flow cytometry,
    by essentially collapsing this data into a bulk measurement. The following
    functions will facilitate annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-
    lapse data utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of individual
    cells in each sample. This package was developed based for analysis of yeast
    expressing fluorescent proteins on a BD Accuri SORP cytometer, but may be
    adapted for analysis of other data.
